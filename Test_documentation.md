# Testing documentation

This document should be addapted when new testdocumentation is available via a link made in this doc. The hyperlink should direct the tester to the right documentation section.

At this moment Q&A is using sphinx in order to generate automated documentation which is then added to the automated tested section.

All test scenarios should be clearly described in GIT issues and should be reviewed by Ramez and Lesley.

Documentation on testing needs to be done on Gitbook internal OVC doc. Currently there are two section where testing is described:  
- [Automated testing](https://gig.gitbooks.io/ovcdoc_internal/content/testing/
- [stress testing](https://github.com/0-complexity/ovcdoc_public/blob/master/Testing/StressTesting/Performance%20test%201.0/stress_tests.md)
