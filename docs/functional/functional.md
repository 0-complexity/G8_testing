## Functional Testing

This section describes the tests to be executed in order validate the basic functionality of a G8 installation. It lists the tests and expected test results.

Functional testing requires that the system was installed properly, as documented in the [OpenvCloud Operator's Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gig/ovcdoc_public/details), more specifically in the section [Installation of an OpenvCloud Environment](https://gig.gitbooks.io/ovcdoc_public/content/Installation/Installation.html).

Two types of automated functional tests are available for OpenvCloud:
- [Functional tests hosted on ovc_master](openvcloud/ovc_master_hosted/ovc_master_hosted.md)
- [Functional tests hosted on a compute node](openvcloud/compute_node_hosted/compute_node_hosted.md)
