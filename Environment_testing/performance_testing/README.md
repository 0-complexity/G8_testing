## Performance Testing

The performance testing section was created to validate an OpenvCloud environment from a performance perspective.

In this section of the repository we have a Testsuite directory with the scripts running the actual performance tests:
 
[2_Unixbench2_test](https://github.com/0-complexity/G8_testing/tree/master/Environment_testing/performance_testing/Testsuite/2_Unixbench2_test)    
[10_FIO_testing](https://github.com/0-complexity/G8_testing/blob/master/Environment_testing/performance_testing/Testsuite/10_fio_alba)

The documentation as picked up in the public [G8 Testing Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gig/g8-testing-guide/details) is in the [docs](/docs/test_cases/performance/performance.md) directory.

Please only add here **internal** documentation, all other (public) documentation should be added into the [docs](/docs) directory.
